<h1>Module 2: Ingest data into Dynamics 365 Customer Insights - Data</h1>

<h2>Lab Scenario: Contoso Coffee</h2>
<p>Contoso Coffee produces high-quality coffee and coffee machines, which they retail through channels including new Contoso Retail Stores in premium locations, premium food resellers, and the Contoso Coffee Web Site. Contoso plans to further expand their offerings with Contoso Cafes and a new Connected Coffee Machine which can trigger refill orders and alert Contoso Service about any issues. This new offering will help them to build direct relationships with their customers and learn more about how customers consume their products.</p>

<h3>Contoso Coffee’s Challenges</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Transactional Relationship:</strong> Their existing business model means that they lack a direct relationship with their customers.</li>
<li><strong>Data Silos:</strong> They are unable to deliver personalized customer experiences.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Contoso’s Existing Data Landscape</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fractured Customer Data:</strong> With multiple systems, Contoso has multiple records for the same person. This causes a disjointed experience to the customer who expects to be treated as one person regardless of the channel they are transacting upon.</li>
<li><strong>Multiple Platforms:</strong> The architecture at Contoso has evolved through acquisition and legacy systems meaning that data can reside in not only different systems, but different platforms across multiple clouds and on-premise.</li>
<li><strong>Non-Customer Data:</strong> Contoso is drawing correlations between non-customer data and the impact it has on customer experiences, including data from third parties such as weather data.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Contoso Coffee Customer Insights Project</h3>
<p>You have been selected as the project manager for the implementation of Dynamics 365 Customer Insights at Contoso Coffee. As an experienced project manager, you devise the following plan:</p>
<ol>
<li>Create a Customer Insights environment</li>
<li>Ingest data from highest priority data sources from within the business:</li>
<li>Point-of-Sale (POS)</li>
<li>Loyalty Data</li>
<li>Ecommerce Customers</li>
<li>Web Purchases</li>
<li>Create a unified customer profile from ingested data</li>
</ol>

<h2>Module Introduction</h2>

<h3>Lab pre-requisites:</h3>
<p>Before you can start this exercise, you must have completed Lab 0 to set up your environment.</p>

<h3>Data Ingestion & Data Unification</h3>
<p>As Project Manager for Contoso Retail, you will create a unified customer profile by ingesting key sources of customer data and following the Map, Match, and Merge process. In this lab, we will ingest data. In the next lab, we will unify the data.</p>

<strong>Approximate Time to Complete:</strong> 45 minutes

<h3>Familiarize yourself with Customer Insights - Data</h3>
<p>In this task, you will explore the pre-configured Demo environment to familiarize yourself with moving around in the Customer Insights – Data application.</p>
<ol>
<li>Sign in to Customer Insights - Data at https://home.ci.ai.dynamics.com if you are not already signed in.</li>
<li>In the Environment selector in the top right-hand corner, confirm <strong>Marketing Trial</strong> is selected.</li>
<li>Explore the left-hand menu options to familiarize yourself with the navigation:</li>
<li><strong>Home:</strong> Home Page</li>
<li><strong>Customers:</strong> View cards for unified Customer Profiles (you won't be able to view this yet - we need to ingest and unify our data first)</li>
<li><strong>Data > Data sources:</strong> Ingest siloed demographic, transactional, or behavioral data. Map, match, and merge into a Unified Customer Profile. View your entities and define activity types and their relationships to your customers.</li>
<li><strong>Data > Enrichment:</strong> Go beyond your unified profile and enrich customer profiles with Microsoft Proprietary Data. Unlock data on affinities for hundreds of brands and dozens of interest-categories. These affinities are extracted for profiles that might be like your customers.</li>
<li><strong>Insights > Segments, Measures & Predictions:</strong> View segments, configure measures, and use out-of-the-box prediction models (or build your own). (You won't be able to view this section yet.)</li>
<li><strong>Settings:</strong> Administer Roles, Permissions, APIs, and Export Destinations for Customer Segments.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Exercise 1 - Data Ingestion</h2>
<p>In this lab, you will become familiar with ingesting data from multiple sources.
